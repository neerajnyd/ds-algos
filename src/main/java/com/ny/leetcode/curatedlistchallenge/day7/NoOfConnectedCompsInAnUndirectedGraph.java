https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-connected-components-in-an-undirected-graph/

Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes),
write a function to find the number of connected components in an undirected graph.

Example 1:
     0          3
     |          |
     1 --- 2    4
Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]], return 2.
